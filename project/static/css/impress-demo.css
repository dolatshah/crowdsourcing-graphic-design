    And as the last thing there is a workaround for quite strange bug.
    It happens a lot in Chrome. I don't remember if I've seen it in Firefox.

    Sometimes the element positioned in 3D (especially when it's moved back
    along Z axis) is not clickable, because it falls 'behind' the <body>
    element.

    To prevent this, I decided to make <body> non clickable by setting
    pointer-events property to `none` value.
    Value if this property is inherited, so to make everything else clickable
    I bring it back on the #impress element.

    If you want to know more about `pointer-events` here are some docs:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events

    There is one very important thing to notice about this workaround - it makes
    everything 'unclickable' except what's in #impress element.

    So use it wisely ... or don't use at all.
*/
.impress-enabled          { pointer-events: none }
.impress-enabled #impress { pointer-events: auto }

/*
    There is one funny thing I just realized.

    Thanks to this workaround above everything except #impress element is invisible
    for click events. That means that the hint element is also not clickable.
    So basically all of this transforms and delayed transitions trickery was probably
    not needed at all...

    But it was fun to learn about it, wasn't it?
